## Introduction
This is an implementation of the search algorithms using UCS and A*. The task is to let the robot carry widgets to given positions. The performance of algorithms are evaluated based on four metrics: task success, Path cost, Time Elapsed, and Nodes Expanded.
The performance is mainly affected by the heurtistics in A* algorithm.

## how to run:
call python play.py testcases/ex1.txt to see the demonstration
call python tester.py and read the message to run UCS or A* algorithm and see the result
